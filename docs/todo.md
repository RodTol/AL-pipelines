# TODO

## Development

1. [ ] Create pipeline for simple alignemnt
2. [ ] Add quick check
3. [ ] Move to parallelization
4. [ ] Could we use minmap2 fast or minmap2-ax (GPU implementation!)


## Questions
- Is a problem if my BAM files have `10G_aligned.bam had no targets in header.` ?

## For tomorrow
Finish to implement the standard alignment pipeline with .json file for settings. Then start to think about live reading !
